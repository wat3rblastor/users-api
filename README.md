## Approach

I focused on designing each API endpoint individually, iterating on the functionality as needed. This method allowed me to efficiently develop and adapt each endpoint by building on existing structures.

## Takeaways

I learned the importance of hiding sensitive variables in a .env file. Moving forward, Iâ€™ll ensure to apply this practice across all my projects for better security and maintainability.

## Challenges

One challenge was standardizing error codes across the application, which required careful planning and implementation.

I also had to create a frontend from scratch, as I only discovered DISC through an email about the Discover program. The primary difficulty in building the frontend was deciding which state variables to use, leading to several changes in implementation before finding the right approach. Additionally, I learned that .env variables for the frontend must start with NEXT_PUBLIC_, which took some time to figure out.
